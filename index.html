            <p class="description-one">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San
            Francisco, California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan
            Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist
            Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its
            first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention
            from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other popular
            acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s
            Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed even
            further, pushing them to sign with Magenta Records. </p>
            <p class="description-two">From there, the band has soared, gaining international
            recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New
            fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic
            attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest
            up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
            themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and
            authentic performances on stage. Looking forward to touring in
            the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording their second
            studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.</p>
